          ID is a JSON-LD construct that uniquely identifies attached content within the scope of a given message.
          Recommended on appended attachment descriptors. Possible but generally unused on embedded attachment descriptors.
          Never required if no references to the attachment exist; if omitted, then there is no way
          to refer to the attachment later in the thread, in error messages, and so forth.
          Because @id is used to compose URIs, it is recommended that this name be brief and avoid spaces
          and other characters that require URI escaping.

          content-addressable storage. This may also be undesirable, if dynamic content at a specified
